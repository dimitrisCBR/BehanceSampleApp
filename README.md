# Android Behance Sample Browser
`Powered By Behance`


Example Android project, using Behance's API. I try to maintain this repo as a project of best practices in app architectures and UI.
 
 More info about Behance API on: https://www.behance.net/dev/api/endpoints/
 
 The UI is based on Behance's official app as well as this: https://www.uplabs.com/posts/behance-android-app
